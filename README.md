# Vigenere Cipher - Vigenere.py
The program is a basic implementation of the vigenere cipher.

An alphabet is declared as a string of all letters in the english alphabet at the start of the program which determines the rank of each character. This rank is obtained by getting the index of the character in question on the 'alphabet' string.

The program then takes two strings as input from the user i.e. the key and the message
- the the key defined is used to encrypt the message.

Once the two are entered the program loops through all characters in the message stringa and generates a corresponding ciphertext which is appended to the final cipher string. 

The end result is printed out on standard output.
